My name is Amy Tai and I am a data scientist and researcher from Canada working on healthcare solutions. 

My work experience as a data scientist and applied scientist at companies like Capital One and Microsoft focused on applications such as fraud detection models and recommendation systems. In my spare time, I conduct research at one of the top engineering universities in Canada in the field of medical imaging and computer vision centered around cancer detection and treatment planning. 

I enjoy exciting challenges and I love learning new skills. I am particularly passionate about data science, healthcare technologies, sustainability, and giving back to the community.
