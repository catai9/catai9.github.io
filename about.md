My name is Amy Tai and I am currently studying 
[Management Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/management-engineering){: target="_blank"} at the University of Waterloo. 

Within the university, I volunteer with various organizations to promote Women in Engineering such as the [WiE Outreach Squad](https://uwaterloo.ca/women-in-engineering/volunteer-opportunities) and [ONWiE](http://www.onwie.ca/amy-tai/). In the past, I held an Undergraduate Research Assistantship (URA) in the topic of Data Security and Applied Cryptography and assisted in the publication of an [Energy Consumption Research Paper](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/) located in Technical Reports under #3. 

In the past, I have completed a [BEST Course on Smart Technology](https://bestgraz.org/courses/wintercourse2018/) in **Graz, Austria**, worked as a Software Intern at [Honeywell Interational](https://www.honeywell.com/) in **Atlanta, Georgia**, and participated in an [Overseas Youth Language Program](https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/Pages/VDetail.aspx?nodeid=4280&pid=9679336) in **Taiwan**.

I spend my spare time swimming, going on adventures with my friends and reading books. I also co-ran the [University of Waterloo Entrepreneurship Society](https://entsoc.ca/) in Spring 2019. 

I love to meet new people through volunteer events, coffee chats, and participating in new activities.
