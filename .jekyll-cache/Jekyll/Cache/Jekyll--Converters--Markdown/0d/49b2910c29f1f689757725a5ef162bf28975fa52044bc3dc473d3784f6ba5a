I"k<p>My name is Amy Tai and I am currently studying 
<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/management-engineering" target="_blank">Management Engineering</a> at the University of Waterloo.</p>

<p>Within the university, I volunteer with various organizations to promote Women in Engineering such as the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/women-in-engineering/volunteer-opportunities">WiE Outreach Squad</a> and <a href="http://www.onwie.ca/amy-tai/">ONWiE</a>. In the past, I held an Undergraduate Research Assistantship (URA) in the topic of Data Security and Applied Cryptography and assisted in the publication of an <a href="http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/">Energy Consumption Research Paper</a> located in Technical Reports under #3.</p>

<p>In the past, I have completed a <a href="https://bestgraz.org/courses/wintercourse2018/">BEST Course on Smart Technology</a> in <strong>Graz, Austria</strong>, worked as a Software Intern at <a href="https://www.honeywell.com/">Honeywell Interational</a> in <strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>, and participated in an <a href="https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/Pages/VDetail.aspx?nodeid=4280&amp;pid=9679336">Overseas Youth Language Program</a> in <strong>Taiwan</strong>.</p>

<p>I spend my spare time swimming, going on adventures with my friends and reading books. I also co-ran the <a href="https://entsoc.ca/">University of Waterloo Entrepreneurship Society</a> in Spring 2019.</p>

<p>I love to meet new people through volunteer events, coffee chats, and participating in new activities.</p>
