I"‹<p>A program that takes the pyramidâ€™s height as an input parameter and outputs a pyramid of the requested height.</p>

<p>This project was completed as part of the Introduction to Computer Programming course.</p>

<p>Please note that there is no link to the code as this was developed for an university course assignment and the professor requested that the code be kept private. However, I was awarded 100% in this assignment.</p>

<p>Technologies used include Processing 3.</p>
