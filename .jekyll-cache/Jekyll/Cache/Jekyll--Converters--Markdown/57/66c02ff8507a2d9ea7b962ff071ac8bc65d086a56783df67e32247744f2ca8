I"Ø<p>Implementation of a ‚Äú20 Questions‚Äù yes/no guessing game between a user and a computer.</p>

<p>The computer increases in intelligence with each losing game as the player is required to supply a new question to the computer that will assist in the differentiation between the object that the computer guessed and what the user is thinking.</p>

<p>The program uses test files as storage and implementation with recursion rather than loops as required by the assignment condition.</p>

<p>Technologies used include Java, Binary Tree, Recursion, Eclipse.</p>
