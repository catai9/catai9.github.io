I"Ì<p>A digital version of Hangman that processes user input and keeps track of the game state.</p>

<p>This project was completed as part of the Introduction to Computer Programming course.</p>

<p>Please note that there is no link to the code as this was developed for an university course assignment and the professor requested that the code be kept private. However, I was awarded 100% in this assignment.</p>
