I"I<p>Java coding answers to HackerRank questions including the ones in the 30 day challenge.</p>

<p>The 30-day challenge tests concepts such as if-else statements, recursion, data structures, object-oriented programming, running time, and testing.</p>

<p>When preparing for a coding interview, I discovered HackerRank and its contests. I chose to embark on a “30 Days of Code” challenge to refresh my Java coding skills before working on harder questions.</p>

<p>This Github repository contains my answers to select key questions in the 30 day challenge and other HackerRank problems that I believe highlight important Java concepts.</p>
