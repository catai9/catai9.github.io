I"ã<p>The 6 things that should be included in any project brief
    Goals of the project
    Budget
    Timeframe
    Users and target audience
    Design consideration and preferred aesthetic
    Success criteria</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at each of them a more deeply.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Goals of the project</li>
</ol>

<p>If you‚Äôre outsourcing some projects of yours, you need to know what you want to achieve and have a crystal clear picture of it in your head. The reverse-engineer approach will play great in supporting your outlining process, even for those minor yet requested tasks that would bring to life your desired outcome.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Budget</li>
</ol>

<p>The budget is all the money you‚Äôd want to invest in a specific project you outsource. More precisely, you allocate budget for a project, meaning that you should already have a clear plan in your mind about the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äù that project is crucial to your business goals. Writing down the budget (or at least a budget range) on your project brief is an effective way to save time.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs the same as when you go car shopping, and you give a price range to the reseller, so he doesn‚Äôt waste your time showing you cars you‚Äôre not interested in (or can‚Äôt afford, simply).
Long story short: put a number on it.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Timeframe</li>
</ol>

<p>Just as with knowing how much money you‚Äôre able to invest in an outsourced project, you should also provide a specific timeframe the project needs to be developed and delivered within. This allows the developer to set expectations realistically. Be reasonable, though: if you‚Äôre one of those who answer ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äù when they‚Äôre asked when a deadline is, you won‚Äôt find remote developers and experts wanting to work with you. Forewarned is forearmed.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Users and target audience</li>
</ol>

<p>You‚Äôre asking an expert to build something for you, whether it‚Äôs a new website, a landing page, e-commerce, whatever. A crucial information that will help them working their magic out is knowing who you‚Äôre targeting, your prospects. This way an expert can evaluate several factors (design, technology, etc.) that pertain to specific users and provide you with the best solution accordingly.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Design consideration and preferred aesthetic</li>
</ol>

<p>When it comes to qualitative and aesthetic considerations writing down all preferred elements isn‚Äôt the most suitable way to share that kind of information, while showing them is a better way. When writing your brief, add resources to leave misunderstandings out the door: try pairing any element of design you‚Äôd want with a description or comment. You can pick examples from websites, books, sketches, and anything you shows what you‚Äôre looking for. While the project is running, lead the expert with your feedback.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Success criteria</li>
</ol>

<p>One element that often get left out from a project brief is how you will measure the success of the project itself in an objective way: the KPIs. What are the Key Performance Indicators? They‚Äôre measurable metrics by which a project can be judged as a success (or not) in accordance with the client‚Äôs primary goal. Some examples of KPIs for web projects can be:</p>
