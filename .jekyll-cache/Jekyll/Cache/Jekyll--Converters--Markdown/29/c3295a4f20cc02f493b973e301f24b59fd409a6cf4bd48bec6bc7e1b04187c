I"¯<p>A winter scenery drawing that was created on Processing that fulfilled assignment requirements such as 5 different shapes, multiple stroke thicknesses, an embedded image, at least 4 different colours, etc.</p>

<p>This project was completed as part of the Introduction to Computer Programming course.</p>

<p>Please note that there is no link to the code as this was developed for an university course assignment and the professor requested that the code be kept private. However, I was awarded 100% in this assignment.</p>

<p>Technologies used include Processing 3.</p>
