I"ä<p>A fun way to practice adding two numbers together where users can write their answer on a black canvas to be verified against the correct answer.</p>

<p>The TensorFlow model for predicting the handwritten digits was trained in batches of 1000 with two hidden layers, 50 epochs and a learning rate of 0.001. The modelâ€™s accuracy on the test set was 97.58%.</p>
