A file reader analyzer that takes in a document in .TXT-format and outputs statistics such as the number of words, paragraphs, and characters (excluding spaces). 

This project was completed as part of the Introduction to Computer Programming course.

Please note that there is no link to the code as this was developed for an university course assignment and the professor requested that the code be kept private. However, I was awarded 100% in this assignment. 

Technologies used include {{page.technologies}}.
