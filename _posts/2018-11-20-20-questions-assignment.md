Implementation of a "20 Questions" yes/no guessing game between a user and a computer.

The computer increases in intelligence with each losing game as the player is required to supply a new question to the computer that will assist in the differentiation between the object that the computer guessed and what the user is thinking.

The program uses test files as storage and implementation with recursion rather than loops as required by the assignment condition.
