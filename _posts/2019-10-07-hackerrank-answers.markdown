Java coding answers to HackerRank questions including the ones in the 30 day challenge. 

The 30-day challenge tests concepts such as if-else statements, recursion, data structures, object-oriented programming, running time, and testing.

When preparing for a coding interview, I discovered HackerRank and its contests. I chose to embark on a "30 Days of Code" challenge to refresh my Java coding skills before working on harder questions.

This Github repository contains my answers to select key questions in the 30 day challenge and other HackerRank problems that I believe highlight important Java concepts.
