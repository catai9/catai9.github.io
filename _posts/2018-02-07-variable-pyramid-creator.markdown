A program that takes the pyramid's height as an input parameter and outputs a pyramid of the requested height.

This project was completed as part of the Introduction to Computer Programming course.

Please note that there is no link to the code as this was developed for an university course assignment and the professor requested that the code be kept private. However, I was awarded 100% in this assignment. 

Technologies used include {{page.technologies}}.
