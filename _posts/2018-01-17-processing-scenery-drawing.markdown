A winter scenery drawing that was created on Processing that fulfilled assignment requirements such as 5 different shapes, multiple stroke thicknesses, an embedded image, at least 4 different colours, etc.

This project was completed as part of the Introduction to Computer Programming course.

Please note that there is no link to the code as this was developed for an university course assignment and the professor requested that the code be kept private. However, I was awarded 100% in this assignment. 

Technologies used include {{page.technologies}}.
