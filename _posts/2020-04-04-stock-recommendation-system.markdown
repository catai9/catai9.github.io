An application that determines the optimal investment strategy given user preference constraints and historical data for stocks. 

This application was developed in under 2 months and used ANN to predict the next day's closing price based on historical data. 

Please note that there is no link to the code as this was developed for an university course assignment and the professor requested that the code be kept private. However, I was awarded 100% in this assignment.
