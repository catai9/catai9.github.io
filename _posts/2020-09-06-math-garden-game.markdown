A fun way to practice adding two numbers together where users can write their answer on a black canvas to be verified against the correct answer.

The TensorFlow model for predicting the handwritten digits was trained in batches of 1000 with two hidden layers, 50 epochs and a learning rate of 0.001. The model's accuracy on the test set was 97.58%.
